# ScanAssess

A DART web app for assessing switch scanning

ScanAssess is a web app which allows switch scanning as an access method to a keyboard to be tried and assessed.  

ScanAssess allows any keyboard key to be used as a switch, thereby allowing the use of any switch interface which emulates a keyboard key.

The app contains an alphabetical and qwerty keyboard, as well as numerous scan patterns and scan settings.

A target phrase can be typed in by the clinician.  Once the target phrase has been completed using scanning, a results page summarises the performance of the scan.

ScanAssess was built as part of an honours project for a BSc in Computing with the Open University.
